### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer experienced with Python and Go. While most of the projects here are for training and experimentation, there are also some comprehensive programs.

Currently, I'm working on [a Telegram bot](https://github.com/AndreyAD1/helsinki-guide) that presents information about notable Helsinki buildings. Since the Helsinki Guide bot has a quite diverse interface, I made up [UI tests based on Robot Framework and Selenium](https://github.com/AndreyAD1/helsinki-guide-test).

Another funny project is [a console game written in Go](https://github.com/AndreyAD1/spaceship) that utilises goroutine synchronization. Although it may not be the conventional way to write games, this experiment was both fun and very beneficial for understanding Go.
