### Hi! Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer experienced in Python and Go. While most of the projects here are for training and experimentation, there are also some comprehensive programs.

Currently, I'm working on [a console game written in Go](https://github.com/AndreyAD1/spaceship) that utilizes goroutine synchronization. Although it may not be the conventional way to write games, this experiment is both fun and very beneficial for understanding Go.
