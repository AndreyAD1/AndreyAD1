### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer experienced in Python and Go. While most of the projects here are for training and experimentation, there are also some comprehensive programs.

My latest project is [a console game written in Go](https://github.com/AndreyAD1/spaceship) that utilizes goroutine synchronization. Although it may not be the conventional way to write games, this experiment was both fun and very beneficial for understanding Go.

Currently, I'm working on [a Telegram bot](https://github.com/AndreyAD1/helsinki-guide) that presents information about notable Helsinki buildings.
